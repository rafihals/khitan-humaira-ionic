      <p class="season--about">Autumn, also known as fall in American English and sometimes in Canadian English,[1] is
        one of the four temperate seasons. Autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September (Northern
        Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere), when the duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the
        temperature cools down considerably. One of its main features is the shedding of leaves from deciduous trees.

      <h3 class="season--title">Winter</h3>
      <p class="season--about">Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate zones (winter does not
        occur in most of the tropical zone). It occurs after autumn and before spring in each year. Winter is caused by
        the axis of the Earth in that hemisphere being oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different
        dates as the start of winter, and some use a definition based on weather. When it is winter in the Northern
        Hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. In many regions, winter is associated with
        snow and freezing temperatures.</p>
